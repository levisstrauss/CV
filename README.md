I' am student in computer science

I enjoy building digital products that either solve problems or entertain people. Preferrably in Javascript or Python.

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going.

## Experience:
### Founders & Coders (2015)
In early 2015 I enrolled as a student at Founders & Coders in London. F&C is a 3 month intensive coding course with a focus on Javascript and Node JS. After graduation, I've worked with commercial clients, mostly building MVP's for startups.

### Propell (2012 - 2014)
After finishing my studies I founded a kids app startup named Propell, which I ran for 2.5 years as the CEO. Propell's childrens books, educational material and music apps have been downloaded over 1 million times by parents around the world. My responsibilities included management, marketing & PR, administration, accounting and everything else related to running a startup.

### Mikrojobb (2011)
While studying, I founded a Norwegian site to buy and sell micro services. Mikrojobb quickly grew to be the most popular of its kind in Norway and was aquired by NeedBox.com in 2013.

## Projects I've coded:
### Keyword King
A webapp that instantly shows you your app's underperforming keywords in the App Store.
